# procedural-locomotion

Code base for the project: Procedural Locomotion Engine For Digital Humans.

## Getting started

We recommend [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for the development.
It is a paid software, but JetBrains has the [student plan](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
that provides free licenses. See [this](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/clion-quick-start-guide.html) for a quick
start guide.

1. Fork this repository and download the code.

## Immediate Next steps

- Implement an inverse kinematics solver: feel free to modify and use the one
  from [a1](https://github.com/Digital-Humans-23/a1)
- Design a strategy for arm motions.
- Review biomechanics, computer graphics and robotics literature for natural ankle motion.

## Comments

- If you want to start from scratch (instead of using this code), feel free to do it!
- This repo will be keep updated, so please stay tuned. If you want to sync your repo with the new commits,
  use ```git rebase``` instead of ```git merge```:
  see [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) for more details of ```git rebase```.
- Please actively use GitHub issue for questions and reporting issues on the code base!
